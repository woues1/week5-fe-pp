# 1.
```js
jobSchema.set("toJSON", {
  virtuals: true,
  transform: (doc, ret) => {
    ret.id = ret._id;
    return ret;
  },
});
```

The previous code represents a Mongoose schema for a "job" model. Mongoose assign an automatically generated _id field to each document in the database, but it's more user-friendly to use id, which is why this code snippet adds a new field called id, which mirrors the value of _id.


# 2.
```js
app.use(cors());
```

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page. This helps prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to a server on behalf of the user. A request from the frontend to the backend would be blocked by the browser. By default, app.use(cors()); allows all origins.


# 3.
```js 
proxy: {
  "/api": {
    target: "http://localhost:4000",
    changeOrigin: true,
  },
},
```

Previous code snippet sets up a proxy for requests, which is crucial for handling cross-origin requests. The proxy feature kind of rewrites the request path and forwards it to the backend server. Without the profy, if the frontend and backend are running on different ports the browser will block requests from the frontend to the backend due to previously mentioned CORS restrictions. The proxy configuration helps bypass this problem by making the request appear as though it is coming from the same origin.
